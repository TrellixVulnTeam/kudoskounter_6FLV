# Kudoskounter

Silly project made for fun to track kudos between me and a friend. Shows amount of kudos and a list of instances where it was granted.
Storage method is naive and only uses a csv file. Please note that there are some "hacks" because of unicode encoding that could easily by fixed by generalizing names and allowing users to input their own names.  
Also note that the background-image is way too large and makes loading slow, I was just too lazy to edit it as this project was mostly a joke.
